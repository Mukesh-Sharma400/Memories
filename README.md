## Technologies Used

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): A NoSQL database used for persistent data storage.
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/): A backend framework facilitating the creation of scalable and modular RESTful APIs.
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/): Forms the core of the user interface, enabling dynamic and interactive components.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): A server-side runtime environment for efficient handling of HTTP requests, database interactions, and business logic implementation.
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/): A state management library employed to handle global application state and provide a predictable and centralized data flow.
- [Redux-Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk): Middleware that enhances Redux functionality by enabling asynchronous actions for seamless integration with APIs and data fetching.
- [Google OAuth](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2): Integrated for user authentication and secure login using Google accounts.
- [CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS): Employed to enable secure cross-domain communication for integration with external APIs and services.
- [Context/RESTful API](https://restfulapi.net/rest-architectural-constraints/): Practices used for efficient data management and communication between components, ensuring a scalable and maintainable codebase.
